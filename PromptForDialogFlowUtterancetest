# Copilot Prompt:
# Write a Python script that uses the dfcx-scrapi library to automatically test Dialogflow CX utterances.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Import and use the following:
#       from dfcx_scrapi.core.conversation import DialogflowConversation
#       from dfcx_scrapi.analysis import run_intent_detection
#
# 2. Read a CSV file named "utterances.csv" with two columns:
#       utterance, expected_intent
#
# 3. Ask the user to input the Dialogflow agent_id (via input()).
#    Example: projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/agents/<AGENT_ID>
#
# 4. Create a DialogflowConversation object using the provided agent_id.
#
# 5. Pass that conversation object and the DataFrame into run_intent_detection()
#    to test all utterances automatically.
#
# 6. The results should include columns like:
#       utterance, expected_intent, detected_intent, confidence, match
#    Compare expected_intent vs detected_intent and compute accuracy.
#
# 7. Print the accuracy percentage and save the output to a file called
#       intent_test_results.csv
#
# 8. Keep the code short (under ~50 lines) and simple to understand.
#
# Example terminal output:
# Enter your Dialogflow agent_id: projects/demo/locations/us-central1/agents/abcd1234
# Running utterance tests...
# âœ… Test completed. Accuracy: 94.7%
# Results saved to intent_test_results.csv
